## 🚀 Features

- 📊 **Rainfall Prediction Model:**  
  Time series model trained on IMD data to forecast rainfall in mm.

- 🗺️ **Flooded Area Segmentation:**  
  Semantic segmentation using satellite images to identify flooded regions.

- 🌧️ **Risk Assessment System:**  
  Combines rainfall, elevation, drainage network, and land use data to compute flood risk across Mumbai.

- 📍 **Interactive Map & Alert System:**  
  Web-based dashboard to visualize risk zones and push alerts to residents.

- 🧠 **Integrated AI Pipeline:**  
  Combines predictive models, geospatial analysis, and real-time user interaction.
